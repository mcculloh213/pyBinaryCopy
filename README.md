# pyBinaryCopy
Converts an input file to output binary

## binary-copy
To run in the console, enter `$ python main.py "<path to file>"`. If the run succeeds, the resulting binary .txt file will be placed in `./data/recv/`, else an error message can be found in  `./data/err/`. This was built using Python 3.5 and will not work in Python 2.x.
